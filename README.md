# Excel Ad-hoc Projects

### **Statistical Insights into Vehicle Fuel Efficiency**

This project explores the factors influencing vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG) using statistical analysis and visualization in Excel. A two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the average MPG between cars manufactured in Europe and the USA, revealing a statistically significant difference favoring European vehicles. Additionally, linear regression models highlighted relationships between MPG and two key predictors: vehicle weight and horsepower. The analyses showed strong negative correlations, with approximately 69% of MPG variation explained by weight and 60% by horsepower, highlighting their predictive power in understanding fuel efficiency trends.

**Manufacturing Line Productivity Analysis**

This Excel-based project analyzes production efficiency and operator performance across a beverage manufacturing line. It integrates batch-level timing data, product specifications, and categorized downtime factors to assess productivity. Key metrics such as efficiency ratios, top-performing operators, and downtime root causes are calculated and visualized through a structured data model. A Pareto analysis and a dashboard view highlights the most impactful delays, offering actionable insights to improve operational performance.
